### Most challenging issue and how you dealt with it

#### The most challening issue we ran into this project was how to pick-up dynamic blocks, and succesfully stack them onto our goal platform.

##### How to select which block to pick up
##### Should the end-effector pick up a block from anywhere in the reachable workspace
##### Best scooping motion of the block
##### Quickest path back to goal platform
##### Max Stacking height
##### Trying to get the side bonus
##### How to handle corner cases (Infinite wait, Unreachable blocks, etc.)

### How this project demonstrates technical growth on your part since the beginning of the semester
